Grocery Shop Management App 

This Salesforce Admin project is designed to streamline small shop management by providing features to manage inventory, daily sales, and customer borrowings.

Key Features:

   Item Management: Users can add shop items with details such as name, price, and other relevant information.

   Daily Sales Tracking: Users can record items sold each day along with their quantities. The system automatically calculates daily totals.

   Borrower Management: Users can add borrowers and track their borrowings. Once a borrower repays the amount, the status can be updated to "Paid", and the corresponding amount is automatically added to the Daily                            Sales on the payment date.

   Sales Report (Lightning Page) A comprehensive Lightning page provides a visual summary of:
      
         1.Daily sales totals
         2.Cumulative sales to date
      
         3.Borrower report including:
               a) List of unpaid borrowers
               b) Total outstanding borrowings

This project demonstrates effective use of Salesforce features like custom objects, Lightning pages, flows, and automation to manage real-world shop operations efficiently.
